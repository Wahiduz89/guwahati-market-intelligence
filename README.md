# Guwahati Hyper-Local Market Intelligence System

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between flood risk zones and commercial revenue in Guwahati.
Using Python, I generated a synthetic dataset of **2,500+ transactions** to simulate real-world retail scenarios.

## Key Features
* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Created a custom Python script to simulate retail transactions.
* **Flood Logic:** Implemented algorithms to simulate a **40% revenue drop** in areas like **Anil Nagar** during monsoon months (June-Aug).
* **Location Analysis:** Compared high-traffic zones (Zoo Road) vs. safer investment zones (Jalukbari).

## Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy (Data Engineering)
* **Power BI:** Star Schema Modeling, DAX
* **Excel:** Data Validation
